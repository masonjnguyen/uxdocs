## Introduction

- **Title**: represents the focus and reason for the study.
- **Author**: Lists the name, title, and email address for the author of the plan.
- **Stakeholders**: Identifies the study's stakeholders, including any groups targeted for testing and people at the company whose work might be affected by the study.
- **Date**: last updated date.

## Project background

This summarizes the situation leading to the need for this research, and also serves as a brief explanation you can give to anyone who asks why you're doing this research.

Establishing a project background is important because it gets the team on the same page at the beginning of the study. Everyone on the team needs to have a common grasp of the history leading up to the current situation. When you write out your project background, you should keep the following three things in mind:

- **Identify the signals that indicated research was necessary**. Ask yourself why you're doing this research and if there's a problem you're trying to solve.
- **Describe any previous research**, such as another iteration of usability testing or concept testing, that has been conducted or solutions that have been tried. How have previous attempts brought us closer to solving the problem?
- **List insights the research will generate**. An insight is an observation about people that helps you understand the user or their needs from a new perspective. In the project background, you should include how the insights will be used and what decisions will be made based on those insights.

## Research goals

Your research goals will state the specific ideas that you want to learn from the research, or what you would like the outcomes of the research to be. That's why identifying your research goals is so important. Essentially, they drive the entire study.

The goals of your research will differ from project to project. But they'll fit into one of these three categories, depending on when you run your research during the product life cycle.

- **Foundational research goal**: If you run research before you start the design process, your research goal should help you understand why, or if, you should build the product, or if there's a need for it at all.

- **Design research goal**: If you run research during the design phase, your goal should help you understand how to build the product. Research at this time is called design research, and it will give you the answers you need to move forward through the design process with confidence.

- **Post-launch research goal**: If you run research on a product after it's launched, your research goals help you understand if the product worked as expected. This type of research is called post-launch research, and the goals reflect whether you have successfully completed what you set out to do.

First, you should identify what part of the product life cycle you're running your research in. Then, you should write either a foundational, design, or post-launch research goal.

## Research questions

Your research questions are the handful of questions you plan to answer during the study. They'll provide focus and structure for your research study, and also be the main topics you cover during your presentation. You should write five research questions for your mock research plan.

You should keep the following things in mind as you write your research questions:

- A good research question should be **actionable**. You should be able to identify a clear way to attempt to answer the question. And you should know when you've found the answer you're searching for.

- Make sure your research questions are **specific** and not too broad. You want to answer specific questions and produce meaningful data.

- Make sure your research questions are **not leading**. Questions should be neutrally phrased so that they don't sound like you're assuming a particular answer to your question.

- You should include one **quantitative** and one **qualitative** research question. Quantitative research focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring (think: numbers). Qualitative research focuses on observations about why and how things happen (i.e., â€œwritten descriptions"). This will help you obtain a greater diversity of data.

## Key Performance Indicators

Common KPIs for UX Design:

- Time on task
- Use of navigation vs. search
- User error rates
- Drop-off rates
- Conversion rates
- System Usability Scale
- Net Promoter Score.

Criteria for choosing KPIs:

- **Measure progress** toward a research goal.
- **Reveal meaningful** insights into user behavior?.
- **Provide actionable feedback** about how the design is performing.

## Methodology

Outlining your methodology is important because it will inform your stakeholders of what will happen during the study, give them confidence in your study's results, and make it easier for researchers to repeat the study in the future.

- The **procedures** for conducting the usability test
- The **time** and **location** the test will occur
- **Who** will be conducting the test, whether it's **moderated** or **unmoderated**
- **How** the test will be conducted

## Participants

With the methodology information clearly defined, the participants details could be decided:

- **Number** of participants.
- **Demographic information** about them (e.g., age, industry, job title, gender, location, ability)
- Participants' primary **characteristics** that make them ideal for the test, and ensure you're gathering feedback from people with **diverse perspectives** and **abilities** (visual impairments, auditory processing challenges, and more).
- **How** the prototypes need to be presented and moderated. This will decide which platforms are selected for the test itself.
- The **incentive** that makes them want to participate in the study and that thanks them for their time: cash, a gift card, or a raffle for a prize.

## Scripts

**Introduction, Basic questions and Prompts**

Questions of script should be:

- **Consistent**: Questions and tasks should be read directly from the script and worded identically for each participant.
- **Open-ended**: Task and follow-up questions encourage discussion and reflection rather than short "yes or no" responses.
- **Objective**: Tasks and follow-up questions don't try to lead participants toward a particular answer or introduce the researcher's personal bias.
- **Goal oriented**: Tasks and follow-up questions relate directly to the research goal.

Interviewers should:

- **Encourage elaboration**: The interviewer should encourage the participant to elaborate when they get stuck.

- **Be flexible**: The interviewer should change the wording of questions they've already asked in order to gain new insights into the original question.

- **Follow the participants' lead**: If the participant explores a different area than what was otherwise expected but it turns out to be important, then leave time to explore that too.

- **Maintain privacy**: The interviewer shouldn't mention other participants during the interview to uphold each participant's privacy. This also prevents any outside opinions from affecting the data.

How to begin an interview:

- Welcome your participants and thank them for their time. Take some time to build rapport, for example, and ask how their day is going. This gives everyone a chance to warm-up.
- Ask for the participant's consent to record the interview.
- Explain why their data is being collected and what it will be used for.
- Ask for basic information such as name, age, and occupation.
- Inform the participant that the interview is not a test, and that no answer is wrong.
- Remind participants to think out loud throughout the interview.
- Set their expectations around what works and what doesn't work in the prototype they will be testing.
- Be an open book! Assure your participants that it's okay to ask questions, ask for clarification, or take a break at any time. This is a a good way to remind them that participation is voluntary.
- Ask for basic information that gives you insights into the participant's relationship with the product and helps them settle into the interview

Tips for writing tasks:

- Tasks should be based on your research goals
- Tasks should be specific
- Tasks should make participants take direct action
- Tasks shouldn't provide clues on how to complete a task. These could be explicit clues and implicit clues too, like using the same name of a call-to-action button in the UI as part of the question itself.
