# Create personas

[Persona template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10a72PKWsZnsXqmERb0qtX-3v9W4VDILFtz0_PudX52I/template/preview)

As a UX designer, you'll need to evaluate, research, and develop personas to represent key user groups. In UX design, personas are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. These user groups are determined by identifying similar responses, behaviors, or characteristics shared among multiple research participants. Understanding that multiple users fit into the same general category helps you begin to define what types of people you're designing for. That's where personas come in.

## Analyze your user notes and identify user groups

Review notes when interviewing and consider gathering some demographic information, such as:

- Location

- Age range

- Education level

- Employment

- Household/family composition

- Other key personal identifiers

A great persona includes relevant information about your target user's life, such as age, education, location, family situation, occupation, goals, and frustrations. You should also consider ability, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and language in your personas, too. Make sure the information you gather isn't used in your persona to reinforce stereotypes. These identifiers give you a well-rounded idea of who your users are. They also help get you thinking about why these people need your product.

## Build personas

After studying your notes, decide on at least two distinct user groups. A user group is a set of people who have similar interests, goals, or concerns.

Once you've decided on your two user groups, sort your interview notes under one of the groups depending on which group they match with the best. In the next step, you'll turn each group into a persona that is a composite of all the users who fit into that group.

Use the persona template to build a persona for each of your user groups.

Your goal is to create a realistic representation of a user who you can empathize with as you think about the design solutions that user might need.

## CoffeeHouse exemplars

[CoffeeHouse business scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ln-ycFqSyOeAKFhVAlKuBVjG6ER6GluJ2JwNwZVwvfU/template/preview)

**Customer type one**:

    - A junior employee in a busy professional firm who is typically under 23 years of age.

    - Several times a week, this customer goes to the CoffeeHouse to pick up an order for themselves and up to twelve coworkers.

    - This customer is on a tight schedule and needs to order high-quality CoffeeHouse items in advance and pick them up quickly and efficiently.

    - The most common frustration for this type of customer involves the coordination of their pick-up. Sometimes a large order is incomplete or incorrect. Other times the order sits too long and their coffee or hot food items get cold.

**Customer type two**:

- Someone who enjoys hanging out at CoffeeHouse and wants a place outside of their home and workplace where they can be connected and productive. This type of customer varies in age and occupation.

- The most common frustrations for this customer involve poor organization at the checkout counter and their inability to find adequate workspace. Waiting in line to place orders and pick up items interrupts their productivity and discourages them from placing an order. It's also important to this customer that they have access to desirable working conditions like a strong Wi-Fi connection and comfortable seating.

**Persona 1**: **Anika, ambitious intern**: Busy junior employee seeking quick and efficient pick-up service.

**Persona 2: Ali, remote upskiller**: In-store customer who wants to enjoy CoffeeHouse items and its atmosphere in a way that allows them to be connected and productive.

## Zia's Pizza exemplars

[Zia's Pizza business scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B-Zw-68SAV3UKEsbygzsykU3-Mp1u2fWp0HawsLqwrU/template/preview)

In our interviews with people who said they were very likely to use a service like Zia's Pizza app, we were able to identify the following user groups:

**Group 1**: Working adults who would like a healthy dinner during the workweek but are not able to cook most work nights. These users:

- Tend to be more advanced in their careers.

- Often work later hours or have a commute that prevents them from getting home from work early enough to cook.

- Have additional obligations, interests, or challenges that make it difficult for them to get groceries for cooking.

- Would use an app to place orders while they are “on the go” and pick up the order on their way home.

**Group 2**: Non-native language speakers who strongly prefer to pick up food rather than eat at a restaurant due to a language barrier. These users:

- Tend to be new residents in the areas that Zia's Pizza serves and are unfamiliar with local shopping options.

- Vary in age, occupation, and number of family members in their home.

- Often feel uncomfortable dining in their local restaurants or shopping in their local grocery stores.

- Would like an app that does not demand advanced English-language experience.

**Persona 1**
The first is a working adult who would like a healthy dinner during the workweek but is unable to cook most work nights

## Assessment of the exemplar

The exemplar has completed all of the worksheet elements, so you get a sense of who the user is and what drives them. Goals and frustrations are highlighted, as well as a breakdown of the personas' demographics. Lastly, a quote that summarizes their personality is featured at the top, along with a paragraph describing their life at the bottom. The goal is to create a realistic persona to empathize with as you think about the type of design solutions your users might need.

Now compare the exemplars above to your completed self-review. Assess what you've done following each of the criteria used to evaluate the exemplars. As you compare, ask yourself:

1. **Demographic information:** Did the demographic information match the persona characteristics given in the activity directions?

2. **Quote:** Were you able to imagine a quote that is relevant to the persona and the background you've built for them?

3. **Goals/Frustrations:** Were the goals and frustrations aligned with the persona and the activity scenario?

4. **Brief story/scenario:** Were you able to give more information about the persona, tying in their goals and frustrations, as well as their quote?

5. **Image:** Did you include a picture or avatar representing the personas for your activity?

What do you do well? Where can you improve? Take this feedback with you as you continue to progress through the course.
