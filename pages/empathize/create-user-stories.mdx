## CoffeeHouse user stories exemplar

**1. Anika:**  
Anika is a marketing intern at a midsized advertising firm. Twice a week, they collect 6-12 coffees from a nearby coffee shop for their team before their morning meeting. But sometimes they find that their order is incomplete or has gotten cold from waiting too long for them to pick it up. They need a way to place an order in advance, track order status, and better plan their arrival for pick-up.

**"As a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for the team, I want to submit and monitor group orders in advance so that I can better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time."**

**2. Ali:**
Ali is a line cook who lives in a small city and mostly works in the evenings. During the daytime, Ali does an online coding boot camp for 3-4 hours to learn a new employable skill. They usually do the boot camp from local coffee shops, but sometimes get frustrated at the limited seating. They also worry about losing their table if they get up to place a new coffee or food order. Ali could use the CoffeeShop app to reserve an in-shop workspace and place their CoffeeShop order through the app once they've arrived.

**"As a remote student who spends 3-4 hours a day studying and purchasing products, I want to be able to order without getting up and potentially losing my table so that I can enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work."**

## Zia's Pizza user stories exemplar

**1. Ying's background:**
Ying is a lawyer with a busy and demanding schedule. They work as a litigation specialist in a mid-size city law firm and swim for a local semi-professional team. Ying has a visual impairment for which they use screen reader technologies. This technology makes online shopping much more convenient for Ying, but not all platforms are effectively equipped for screen reader usage. Ying specifically would like for there to be an easier way to order food to pick up on-the-go.

**2. Jordan's background:**
Jordan is a recent immigrant to the United States and a new English language learner. Jordan sometimes encounters difficulty at the grocery store and at restaurants, which often have limited translation options, and would like for there to be an easier way to order food.

## Assessment of the exemplar

In the exemplar, note that each question (who, what, and why) is answered for each persona. The result is a focused, one-sentence description that will help you understand and prioritize your design goals.

Now compare the examples above to your completed user stories. Assess what you've done using each of the criteria below to evaluate the examples. Does your user story clearly identify the:

- Type of user?

- The “action” that the user hopes will happen?

- The “benefit” the user would receive if the action happens?

If so, great work! This means you have a user story that is user-centered, actionable, and clear. If your user story does not clearly identify these things, please reread the instructions and craft another user story with these criteria in mind.
