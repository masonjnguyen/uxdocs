# Create user journey maps

[User journey map template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rHY-ed1JFNXBXm0UuvMN5qlXG1IkroKeWfKAWlVrT3g/template/preview)

A user journey is the series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal.

- **Not have a product yet:**  
  If you are in the early stages of a project and don't have a working product yet, your journey map would track the general experience the user goes through to complete their goal. In that situation, actions the user takes would look something like below.

  Notice that the actions in the example above are less about what will appear in the product, and more on how the user goes about their day while trying to accomplish their goal.

- **Have a product:**  
  If you're further along in the design process, for example, if this was for a redesign of the CoffeeHouse app, your user journey map would probably include the user interacting directly with your product. In this case, the user's actions might look more like below.

  Since you're just starting the design process for creating a product, your journey map should track the user's general experience of what they go through to achieve their goals. Use what you've learned in your research and be creative as you put yourself in the user's shoes!

The benefits of user journey maps include:

- Helping UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users

- Highlighting pain points

- Identifying improvement opportunities

- Reducing the impact of designer bias

## Steps

**When filling out the template, follow these steps:**

- Add each action the persona takes in their journey to achieve their goal.

- Add 2-3 tasks for each action.

- Indicate how the user feels at each point. Be as specific as possible. What does the user feel as they experience each step in their journey? Try to empathize with the user's experience as much as possible.

- Add opportunities for improvement. These can be ideas that would help resolve the cause of a negative user experience, or ones that take a positive part of the user's experience and build upon it.

- Be proactive and include accessibility considerations.

- When you're finished, go back and check for biases in your assumptions and ideas.

**Some tips to consider:**

- Think about some real-world examples to help you understand how a user uses a product or service like yours.

- Include both positive and negative experiences.

- Think of opportunities that will improve the negative experiences and build upon the positive ones.

- Check along the way for opportunities to consider accessibility and avoid bias.
