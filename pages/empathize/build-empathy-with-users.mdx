# Build empathy with users to inform your research

[Empathize with user exemplar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OK2DvlpyblFNgQ902h1HNnTG-0oF87pskG2-8yjrZ2c/edit#)

## 1. Choose your subjects

Find the sample bios provided below. Select four that you think represent the ideal users of your app. You can change some details about your selected users if needed, to better fit the audience of the app you'll be designing. Just be sure to clarify which details you changed in your final submission.

Although it's not required, you might prefer to conduct interviews with real people at this stage. Interacting with real-life participants can give you an early look into one of the most important parts of many UX design jobs. Websites like UserTesting and User Interviews can help you connect with research participants. If you choose this option, be sure to reference the reading How to determine your research goals and questions as well as the optional readings and videos in this lesson.

Whichever method you choose, you should have four completed empathy exercises (or interviews) by the end of this activity.

## 2. Conduct your empathy exercise

It's time to put yourself in your users' shoes! Pull up the research questions you wrote earlier in this module. In the same document, copy and paste your questions three times, so that you have four identical sets of questions. Then, copy and paste your chosen user bios to the top of each set of questions for reference.

Starting with your first user, review their bio. Now, look at your first research question and imagine how this user might answer it if you were really interviewing them. Do the same with the remaining questions, and then move on to your next user.

Your goal is to think through the opinions, experiences, and pain points of each user. Dig deep into how you imagine these people would answer your questions, and elaborate as much as possible.

Don't worry about writing out your ideas in complete sentences. A bulleted list of main points following each interview question is all you need.

If you chose to interview people instead of using the provided user bios, you can record interview responses as bulleted notes. You don't need to record the interview or create a full transcript, unless you want to!

## 3. Organize your data

At this point, you should have four completed empathy exercises. Great work! We encourage you to spend some time analyzing what you wrote for each sample user and to identify possible commonalities across your user groups — are there features you can incorporate into your design that will work for a variety of users? You'll be learning more about UX design features in later courses, so it's okay to be vague for now.

## 4. Write down how you might solve user problems

Refer back to your work and answer the following question in the same document you completed the empathy exercises in:

How could the needs, challenges, or concerns of your users be resolved?

Imagine that the users you just “interviewed” represent a large segment of the audience for your app. What concerns or problems seem most important to your users? What kinds of features might you build into your app to address these concerns? Be as specific or general as you need to be.

Save the document containing your work where you can easily find it later. You'll be referring to it again when you create personas later in the course.
