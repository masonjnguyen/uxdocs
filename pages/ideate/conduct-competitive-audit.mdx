You've already learned that conducting research on competitors is the cornerstone to understanding your product, the landscape of your industry, and your users. Completing a competitive audit is an effective way to compile all of your research into one central resource. In this reading, we'll break down each step of the competitive audit process in more detail through an example to introduce you to the process. In a later activity, you'll conduct your own competitive audit.

For the example in this reading, imagine you're conducting competitive research on fast-food burger restaurants for your new client, Burger Garden. Burger Garden feels that their current website isn't attracting much business, and they want you to help the company redesign their website.

### Outline the audit goals

As a UX designer, you know that the ideation process is most effective after you've completed an audit on your new client, Burger Garden, and their competitors. But before you move into the details of the audit, you have to define your goals. Since this project is for a website redesign, the goal of the competitive audit is to compare the user experience of each competitor's website.
![Outline the audit goals](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8ByKACaMDkq9WrJSxzT0odK7WsvcMkATfN7XUxPZXBdrluulV9Flm8ukR_FaRuukRVE-SRW8Ve6-4FJzP_0_Bl_1fdCoNJSiA_vVxnQFJ-ALeYjxBW7FlihWa3dEHl4k9UvZ0Rn0vG4mALVU2AZ4gqH=w1920-h279-s-no?authuser=0)

Using consistent language for rating competitor products can also create more uniform feedback and help you “grade” competitors. You can grade competitors on a scale of:

- **Needs work:** The app is not usable, and users aren't getting what they need from this aspect of the app.

- **Okay:** This aspect has some issues, but with some work, it could meet user needs.

- **Good:** This aspect works well, but doesn't always provide users with the necessary information easily.

- **Outstanding:** This aspect feels consistent, and it meets or exceeds the user's needs.

### List competitors

Start to build the competitor audit using the template. First, ask the company or team who they consider to be their direct and indirect competitors. As a reminder, **direct competitors** have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. **Indirect competitors** either have a similar set of offerings but focus on a different audience, or they have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience. Getting this information early can provide good insight into where the company really fits into their industry.

For example, Burger Garden mentioned that Beef Eaters restaurant is one of their direct competitors, so they should be included on the list. Based on your own research, you find two more direct competitors that are also burger restaurants in the same geographical area as Burger Garden, called Burger Nest and The Spotty Cow. You also come across an indirect competitor, The Vegan Cow, that has an international presence and really appealing imagery on their website. The competitor audit spreadsheet now includes the information shown below.
![ List competitors](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8DE_S9CjI070c2fUp_4NR1jRWDnd5C0-Gcdeo0GxVpifZqANpU5H982R0DhZbzWK5-Bx49jMs06JX-vVX51iI7e034ozED3K_AMIdBlo7xsPft6J9CSlpMEdQhg8ejDWzNQ2edMZz06Fh8bCmHB227y=w1920)

### Add competitor information

Next, add the name of each competitor to the spreadsheet, replacing “Competitor #1 name” with the first competitor, and so on. Then, add details about each competitor to the template under the following headings:

- Competitor type (direct or indirect)

- Location(s)

- Product offering

- Price (relative costs from $ - $$$$)

- Website (URL)

- Business size (small, medium, large)

- Target audience

- Unique value proposition

### Determine the specific competitor aspects you want to compare

Defining a list of aspects you want to compare makes it easier to compile your results for analysis later on in the process. For this example, imagine that you check out each of the competitors' websites and rate them based on the following categories:

- **First impressions:** Check out the website on both desktop and mobile devices, and make note of your first impressions. Is the website responsive, meaning that it resizes across devices? Does the design complement the product? How do you feel about the website?

- **Interaction:** Explore the user flow and navigation of the website. What features are available for users? Is the website accessible to all users, including those using screen readers? How inclusive is their website to non-English speakers? Will the user get confused as they click through the website pages, or is the navigation clear?

- **Visual design:** Review competitor branding and their overall consistency. Does the website appear and feel the same throughout all sections and pages? Does the branding match the intended audience? Is the imagery and color palette memorable?

- **Content:** Examine the written content included on the website. Does the tone of the content match the company's branding? Will users be able to find the details they're interested in?

These are the aspects to list across the top row of the competitor audit. In the example spreadsheet, these aspects are listed in rows 3 and 4. This means you would fill in information about these aspects for each of the companies you're evaluating.

### Research each company

Now that the list of competitors and features to compare is filled in, it's time to check out each of Burger Garden's competitors and start the audit. If you were conducting your own audit, you would fill out the spreadsheet row-by-row as you review each competitor. You can include notes in bullet point form, links, and screenshots—whatever is most helpful for your information gathering process! Let's check out each section of the example spreadsheet.

**Audience**
Millennials, including families, make up the biggest portion of the competitors' audiences. There's also a small crossover between millennials and Gen-Z college students. This is very similar to the audience that Burger Garden is targeting. Only one competitor, The Vegan Cow, has a different audience. That's okay! The Vegan Cow wasn't included as a direct competitor because their audience isn't similar to Burger Garden's. It's still important to compare their website and overall user experience to ensure you're getting a good sense of the entire market.

![placeholder](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8BlnQBwhE2sqTahLWcsUK4TYDzH2tbDVJeRog0VwTJoCKOymiqa0Ze3dYUYq62SzsrcKw6IqIthkwam6ELj2L9yLwNzyueQMLxeF6oHL_LiBfWLmPEDB1zJR5Vuc98R9MDWyfjMe0MWiCgkjiWCgNDb=w1920)

**First impressions**
The websites that make the best first impression are The Spotty Cow and The Vegan Cow. Both provide appealing and clear imagery and are fully responsive websites. On the other end, the websites for Beef Eaters and Burger Nest weren't very impressive. While they're easy to navigate, they both need to work on improving their layouts.

For the mobile website experience, only one site had issues with responsiveness: Beef Eaters. Their website didn't adjust to the smaller screen size of a mobile phone, so the spacing was misaligned and some information was cut off.

For the sites with lower ratings, the biggest issue was the menu. Sometimes the menu wasn't accessible, and other times the menu was included as an image that was hard to read. That's definitely something to make note of for your redesign of the Burger Garden website!

![First impression](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8BTMlQTN-dOmz9773ApPXaByJsNJJL_deYDpKZrF_MU1FYVdnwKGOu2WKZ9U9T_fgZB2de9ULot7u91OIBCDm9hA-8d7nouLCqrzApWDy57iRQ585P3b86UaaGMs7wlWXoP0yf1d9MBHcVcVEihuV-M=w1902)

**Interaction**
The next part of the competitive audit focuses on the user's ability to quickly and efficiently find what they're searching for on the website. Your client, Burger Garden, needs help to create a hierarchy for their site that's easier for users to follow and interact with.

The Spotty Cow's website includes animations that slow the navigation, and The Burger Nest's site has lots of unnecessary content on the homepage, which makes it hard to find important information like their phone number and menu. On the other end of the spectrum, the websites that work well have a clear navigation style and make it obvious which elements are clickable and which aren't—a characteristic that's important to include in the redesign of Burger Garden's website. The Vegan Cow is the standout competitor in the category with useful features like a store locator and comprehensive accessibility considerations including multiple language options and compatibility with screen reader technologies.

![Interaction](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8AOYNuhdyxHvUQHWe04uLSiHuttqQcKbwp-rvqrVQw4mP2BlkOBNqXPgxg8DRNggnaTDgwPS0xxp1iaCN4v8dpqEVpQbfpWE5G_XkbUT9cs7Vm62PbuWpfkl1zkQa84mC_ILeyV8k6GvShxpDouS0OW=w1920)

**Visual design**
A website with clear and consistent visual design is a great way to draw users into a product and company. Burger Garden's current website has pretty solid visual design overall, but there are a few areas that could be updated to better reflect their brand tone.

The Spotty Cow and The Vegan Cow communicate their brand well with distinct colors, typography, and photography. But Burger Nest and Beef Eaters both have an inconsistent visual style on their websites, and Burger Nest's site doesn't communicate their brand very well.
![Visual design](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8C9EAblDgjDiLT1JopghJXBjyCq16HRPLokx8v9Xb0DqlDGeuW7JdnXcBgC0udqnwHZxMRaOFCE5zyaa2dk_0Bx2f-I-r5LFXlpFB72WvXeEzk7j5irCTyxOCpxax9fPRTYVTgK2IttCXVilhaJO300=w1920)

**Content**
The tone of the content is another way to communicate a company's brand and engage users. Most of Burger Garden's competitors use an engaging and fun tone that fits their audiences. Burger Garden's tone is a little inconsistent and not as light-hearted as its competitors. This is an area for improvement when you redesign their website!

In general, the competitors' content is short and easy to follow. Burger Garden's current website descriptions come off as a bit dry and overly long, so you can point to competitors' content as an example to follow.
![Content](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8BduYz_fig8lwaBfpu0iPQWaalYIIKoinZ29ZIhfQya4YZf2gsqU2Nt6_fSqfQe1TROvcsF_yweAf-elIbDfxDNLsQUY5BTibd_8QtgJsjYO_0wc7vp7UF3JVeUMCfttQOrQwKiDp5Pln2d3Rh5QGdE=w1920)

### Summarize your findings in a report

After conducting research, gathering data, and analyzing your findings, summarize your work in a report. What you include in your report and how you present your findings will vary depending on the audit goals you outlined at the beginning of the process. For example, if your audit mainly focuses on comparing competitors' audiences, you might want to include a few informational graphics with numbers and figures. Or, if your audit mainly focuses on visual design, you might want to include screenshots of your competitors' websites with different areas highlighted. You'll learn how to create a report summarizing your research findings in more detail later on in the program, so don't worry too much about it right now!

#### Analyze your findings

Examine your completed competitive audit spreadsheet, and try to spot at least 2-3 themes and 2-3 trends:

- In this context, a theme is a high-level idea, like a company that values collaboration or believes in making their product available on lots of devices.

- A trend is how different companies put those ideas into practice. For example, how many companies that value collaboration offer expanded cloud storage for collaborative use? To uncover trends, ask yourself: What are the similarities between you and your competitors? Is there a feature that your competitors all approach in the same way?

#### Summarize your findings in a report

To create your competitive audit report, you’ll present the insights from your audit in narrative form. Consider the themes and trends you uncovered during your audit while writing your report. There are nine sections in the report template, to be filled out as follows:

- To create your competitive audit report, you’ll present the insights from your audit in narrative form. Consider the themes and trends you uncovered during your audit while writing your report. There are nine sections in the report template, to be filled out as follows:

- Competitive audit goal(s). Enter the goal(s) from the top of your audit spreadsheet.

- Who are your key competitors? Consult your research and the General information section of your audit and describe each competitor in 1-2 sentences. Be sure to note whether they are direct or indirect competitors.

- What are the type and quality of competitors’ products? Describe what each competitor offers, making note of what they do well and what they could do better. Your answers should be complete, but relatively brief—no more than a short paragraph (2-5 sentences) for each competitor.

- How do competitors position themselves in the market? Describe each competitor’s target audience in a few sentences. Be specific about characteristics of their ideal customers (e.g., age, location, income, spending habits, etc.).

- How do competitors talk about themselves? Consider each company’s value proposition. Summarize what they claim is unique about their offerings in 2-3 sentences.

- Competitors’ strengths. List 2-4 things each competitor does particularly well.

- Competitors’ weaknesses. List 2-4 things each competitor could do better.

- Gaps. Consider what your competitors fail to do. Identify 2-3 gaps in the market that they do not fill (e.g., design or product features, customization, etc.).

- Opportunities. Consider ways you might address the market gaps you identified. List 2-3 opportunities for your product to stand out from its competitors.

### Completing your audit

Conducting a competitive audit is a great way to familiarize yourself with user experience design by getting more information about a new industry, a new client, and recent industry trends. The information you learn can be used throughout the design process. If you can, it's best to take your time with the competitive audit process so you'll have a great foundation of knowledge to build your designs on moving forward. Good luck!

## Guide for CoffeeHouse competitive audit

### Outline your competitive audit goals

Before you move into the details of your competitive audit, make sure to define your audit goals. In the CoffeeHouse example, since the overall project is for the design of the CoffeeHouse app, your goal could be to **compare the in-app purchasing experience of each competitor**. Once you've chosen your goal or goals, write them in the cell in row 1 where it says “Competitive audit goal”.

Using consistent language for rating competitor products can create more uniform feedback and help you “grade” competitors. You can grade competitors on a scale of:

**Needs work:** The app is not usable, and users aren't getting what they need from this aspect of the app.

**Okay:** This aspect has some issues, but with some work, it could meet user needs.

**Good:** This aspect works well, but doesn't always provide users with the necessary information easily.

**Outstanding:** This aspect feels consistent, and it meets or exceeds the user's needs.

### Add your competitors to the template

You should include three to five competitors in your list. You can identify competitors by searching for products like yours online. Put your competitors' names in the Enter competitor cells in column A, located on the left side of your table. Some competitors should be direct and others should be indirect. Record in the template if that competitor is direct or indirect. Do this in the cell to the right of the competitor's name.

As a reminder:

- **Direct competitors** have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. Essentially, you're both trying to solve the same problem.

- **Indirect competitors** either have a similar set of offerings, but focus on a different audience or have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience.

Including both direct and indirect competitors in your audit gives a better picture of the full competitive landscape.

### Add competitor information to the template

Let's quickly review our template. The names of your competitors are listed down the left side of the spreadsheet in column A, and the competitor type (direct or indirect) is identified next to the competitor name in column B. Additional general information like location, product offering, price, website, business size, target audience, and unique value proposition is listed in columns C through I.
![Add competitor information to the template illustration](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8C-i0pFQbKsUjov2XJIRZrMxgT4so3Bv3fXW2Mn67qyF9YnB9z-BA0RDgZjrlce4Jrt7Z8bp2XR7BQGNjtl9t8rUzwy16at-OwONVtovxk4vdPX86fSK1OLT4FrwhCss-quo9UUMipu5NFPGkg_WRii=w1920)

### Add research findings to the template

Review each competitor's website and app and insert your findings in the spreadsheet. Remember to include details like what works well, what could be improved, and whether your competitor meets the needs of their target audience. As you explore, start by taking note of your initial feelings about your overall experience. The **First Impressions** section of the spreadsheet is meant to be a high-level overview of your competitor's products, so focus on your feelings and impressions rather than specific features and functions.
![Add research findings to the template](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8C4WRwmItRERPwf9IWAMYoWPxS_fBfQowPl_QRmEG7BjGi7qyZYeDxpWD1GBm00dkd8HZIiTdAB1KAJfqmACJKM1ZuCKwAfXEC52zJofIzbMndD_hl4bPDax5O_6S4E4ERzfDRcO0f1XyVYyqcTYnJM=w1920)

For the next sections—**Interaction, Visual design, and Content**—evaluate positive and negative aspects of each category for each competitor, and record your findings in the spaces provided.
![Interaction, Visual design, and Content](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8BVI3NIfr72qzb1W-cziQ83ZmmUiT5CHEZ6MNWsL2k5WHG8IxuVYouKPKiN1J5pumK7UvBucLUxawFagjbba6hsrei78uwjovZgS-ivpcS4iHwV5xEIKEqEW-C1LFD3_4B-6DKKoxsccO91H3OXFhE9=w1920-h374-s-no?authuser=0)

It's also helpful to take screenshots and link to them in the spreadsheet. These will be important to have for presenting your findings later on. You can follow the links below for help with adding images to the spreadsheet template.

### Analyze your findings

Try to notice trends and themes.

**Ask yourself:** What are the similarities and differences between you and your competitors? Is there a feature that your competitors all approach in the same way? Is there a competitor that is doing something completely unique compared to the others? It's a good idea to make note of the findings. You will use this information in your report.

### Summarize your findings in a report

To create your competitive audit report, you'll present the insights from your audit in narrative form. Consider the themes and trends you uncovered during your audit while writing your report. There are nine sections in the report template, to be filled out as follows:

- **Competitive audit goal(s)**. Enter the goal(s) from the top of your audit spreadsheet.

- **Who are your key competitors?** Consult your research and the **General information** section of your audit and describe each competitor in 1-2 sentences. Be sure to note whether they are direct or indirect competitors.

- **What are the type and quality of competitors' products?** Describe what each competitor offers, making note of what they do well and what they could do better. Your answers should be complete, but relatively brief—no more than a short paragraph (2-5 sentences) for each competitor.

- **How do competitors position themselves in the market?** Describe each competitor's target audience in a few sentences. Be specific about characteristics of their ideal customers (e.g., age, location, income, spending habits, etc.).

- **How do competitors talk about themselves?** Consider each company's value proposition. Summarize what they claim is unique about their offerings in 2-3 sentences.

- **Competitors' strengths**. List 2-4 things each competitor does particularly well.

- **Competitors' weaknesses**. List 2-4 things each competitor could do better.

- **Gaps**. Consider what your competitors fail to do. Identify 2-3 gaps in the market that they do not fill (e.g., design or product features, customization, etc.).

- **Opportunities**. Consider ways you might address the market gaps you identified. List 2-3 opportunities for your product to stand out from its competitors.

### Reflect on the completion of this activity

**Does your competitive audit spreadsheet and final report:**

- Identify three to six key competitors, complete with “direct” and “indirect” designations?

- Include clear competitive audit goals at the top?

- Review the products that the competitors have to offer?

- Include three to six features for comparing the businesses that are based on the competitive audit goal?

- Include an analysis of trends among competitors?

- Comment on how your competitors position themselves in the market?

- Examine what the competition does well and what they could do better?

- Consider how the competitors describe themselves?

- Describe the competitors' strengths and weaknesses?

- Highlight gaps in the competitors' products?

- Identify opportunities where your product can stand out and make itself unique?

></iframe>

### Assessment of the exemplar

The example scenario above is from a competitive audit that was completed for CoffeeHouse. The exemplar includes the following actions:

**1. Outlining the goals for the competitive audit**

In order to learn how to make the coffee app, the overall goal was to: Compare the purchasing experience of each competitor's app as a new user and a returning user.

**2. Creating a list of competitors**

First, an online search for CoffeeHouse's product, coffee, was completed. This helped determine who the competitors were. Then, the competitors were added to the spreadsheet which was downloaded at the beginning of the audit.

For our example, two competitors that might have been found during through online research were identified:

- JavaMate, a coffee chain that features a variety of fresh-brewed coffee and specialty drinks. JavaMate is a direct competitor of CoffeeHouse.

- BeanTown, a subscription mail-order service that sends a monthly supply of roasted coffee beans to subscribers' homes. BeanTown is an indirect competitor to CoffeeHouse.

**3. Research**

The research started with downloading and using each competitor's app. Then, the details about the app were entered in the competitive audit comparison spreadsheet.

**4. Analyzing and summarizing the findings**

The information in the spreadsheet was analyzed for trends and themes. To summarize the findings, the competitive audit report template in the instructions was used. In the report, the following points are addressed:

- CoffeeHouse's key competitors

- The products that CoffeeHouse's competitors offered

- How CoffeeHouse's competitors position themselves in the market

- What CoffeeHouse's competition does well and what they could do better

- How CoffeeHouse's competitors describe themselves

- Strengths and weaknesses of CoffeeHouse's competitors

- Gaps in CoffeeHouse's competitor's products

- Opportunities for CoffeeHouse to stand out

Keep in mind this is a very simple report, with only two competitor businesses. Your report may be longer and more detailed than this example.

Now, compare the example spreadsheet and report to the competitive audit comparison and report you created. Assess what you've done using each of the criteria used here to evaluate the exemplar. Did you:

- Identify three to six key competitors, complete with “direct” and “indirect” designations?

- Have a clear competitive audit goal at the top?

- Review the products that the competitors have to offer?

- Have three to six features for comparing the businesses, based on the competitive audit goal?

- Have an analysis of trends among competitors?

- Comment on how your competitors position themselves in the market?

- Examine what the competition does well and what they could do better?

- Consider how the competitors describe themselves?

- Describe the competitors' strengths and weaknesses?

- Highlight gaps in the competitors' products?

- Identify opportunities where your product can stand out and make itself unique?

If so, congratulations! If not, consider going back to make sure you fulfill all the criteria.

[Zia's Pizza competitive audit report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VXTTPij-dIncw09Ew8QX9VnO2iseIzZsToQcRTn0B84/template/preview)

The findings were then analyzed for trends and themes in preparation for the competitive audit report.

The Zia’s Pizza competitive audit report addressed the following points:

- The goal of the competitive audit

- Zia's Pizza’s key competitors (direct and indirect)

- The type and quality of competitors’ products

- How competitors position themselves in the market

- How competitors describe themselves

- Strengths and weaknesses of Zia's Pizza's competitors

- Gaps in competitors’ products and opportunities for Zia's Pizza's product to stand out

Keep in mind this is a very simple report, with only two competitor businesses. Your report may be longer and more detailed than this example.
